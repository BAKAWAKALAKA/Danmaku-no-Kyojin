# Danmaku-no-Kyojin

Danmaku no Kyojin (弾幕の巨人) is a 2D danmaku developed in C# with XNA.

## Project ideas

* Danmaku like (screen full of bullets)
* Boss wave only (no "Campaign", just a survival mode exclusively composed of boss increasingly large)
* 4 difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard, Impossible)
* Boss creation using procedural generation
* Local multiplayer (Player 1: keyboard + mouse, Player 2: game pad)
* Bullet time mode (time is slowed except for player(s))
* Control a ship with keyboard (moving + slow mode) and mouse (shoot + bullet time)
* Simple sprites (geometric) but heavy use of shaders (kikoo effects)
* Bounded area but 2D camera (game area is not limited to the screen size)
